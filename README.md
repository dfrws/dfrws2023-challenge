# dfrws2023-challenge
The DFRWS 2023 challenge (The Troubled Elevator)  takes a deep dive into the domain of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), specifically focusing on programmable logic controllers (PLC). These systems are increasingly critical in various sectors, such as energy, water, transportation, and manufacturing, monitoring and controlling industrial processes. This challenge aims to provide deeper insights into ICS network traffic analysis and device memory in a real-world scenario.
