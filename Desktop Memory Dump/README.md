## How to unzip the Desktop Memory Dump
*.z## files are splitted ZIP archive files. To unzip these files, you will need to follow the steps below:

1. **Make sure all parts are in the same folder**: Before you begin, ensure that all the splitted ZIP files (e.g., z01, z02, ... zxx) are in the same directory along with the main ZIP file.

2. **Use a Compatible Unzipping Tool**: Not all unzipping tools can handle splitted ZIP files. Consider using software like 7-Zip or WinRAR, which support this feature.

3. **Open the Main ZIP File**: Usually, there will be a .zip file with the same name as the splitted files. Open this file using your chosen unzipping tool.

4. **Extract the Files**: Select the main ZIP file and choose the 'Extract' option. The tool should automatically recognize the splitted files and extract them as a single archive.

5. **Verify the Contents**: Once extraction is complete, verify the contents to make sure all parts have been correctly assembled with provided hash in ../README.md.
